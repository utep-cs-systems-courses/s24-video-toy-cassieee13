Lab 3 by Cassandra Alvarez

My program is a simple cup pong game. There are three blue cups and three red
cups (that are actually squares), and two balls on each side. When you load
the msp430, the message "msp430 cup pong" will display over a pink
screen. Press s1 to start a new game. When you start a new game, the fresh
cups will appear and the balls will be on the left of each players
side. Player red will be allowed to shoot first. S2 moves the ball right,
S3 moves the ball left, and S4 shoots the ball. If and only if the ball is
centered to blue's cups, then blue's cup will be removed. If a cup is made or
isn't made, it is the next players turn. When one player wins, a "player __
won" message will display with the players' color as the background along with
a high pitch C note or a low pitch C note. to stop the sound press S4 after
the buzzing has started.If you press S1 in the middle of a game, the cups and score will restart.
